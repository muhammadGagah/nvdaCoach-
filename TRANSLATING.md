# NVDA Coach — Translator Guide

Thank you for contributing a translation! This guide covers everything you need to translate NVDA Coach into your language and test your work as you go.

---

## What You'll Need

- NVDA installed and running
- NVDA Coach installed — download the latest `.nvda-addon` from the [releases page](https://github.com/tonygeb23/nvdaCoach-/releases) and open it to install
- **Poedit** — a free, accessible translation editor that handles compiling for you. Download it at [poedit.net](https://poedit.net). It works well with NVDA.

## What Can Be Translated

NVDA Coach has three layers of translatable content:

| Layer | What it is | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| **UI strings** | Button labels, spoken announcements, status messages, dialog text | `locale/[lang]/LC_MESSAGES/nvda.po` |
| **Lesson content** | Step instructions, hints, chapter titles and descriptions | `globalPlugins/nvdaCoach/lessons/[lang]/` |
| **Documentation** | User guide, practice page, resources page | `doc/[lang]/` |

A UI-only translation is still valuable and can be submitted on its own. All three layers together make a complete translation.

---

## Step 1 — Set NVDA's Language to Yours

1. Press `NVDA+N` to open the NVDA menu
2. Go to **Preferences → Settings → General**
3. Find the **Language** dropdown and set it to your language
4. Press OK and let NVDA restart

NVDA Coach will now look for your language's files automatically.

---

## Step 2 — Find the Installed Add-on Folder

Once NVDA Coach is installed, your files live here:

```
C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Roaming\nvda\addons\nvdaCoach\
```

Inside that folder you'll find your language's scaffold files at:

```
locale\[lang]\LC_MESSAGES\nvda.po
locale\[lang]\LC_MESSAGES\nvda.mo
globalPlugins\nvdaCoach\lessons\[lang]\
doc\[lang]\
```

Replace `[lang]` with your language code (for example: `ru` for Russian, `tr` for Turkish, `pt_BR` for Brazilian Portuguese).

This is where you copy your translated files to test them.

---

## Step 3 — Translate and Test UI Strings (nvda.po)

The translation template is at `locale/nvda.pot`. A scaffold `.po` file for your language is already in the repository with all strings listed and empty `msgstr` fields ready to fill in.

### Translating

1. Open your `nvda.po` file in **Poedit**
2. Fill in your translations — each entry shows the English source on top and an empty field below for your translation:

```po
msgid "Lesson stopped."
msgstr "Lição interrompida."
```

3. Leave `msgstr ""` empty for any string you are not yet ready to translate — NVDA Coach falls back to English for untranslated strings

### Testing

1. Press **Ctrl+S** in Poedit — it saves the `.po` and automatically compiles the `.mo` file alongside it
2. Copy both `nvda.po` and `nvda.mo` into the add-on folder at the path above
3. **Restart NVDA** — press `NVDA+Q`, choose Restart, then reopen NVDA Coach with `NVDA+Shift+C`

You should now hear your translated strings.

### Tips

- Strings containing `{placeholders}` like `{name}` or `{stepNum}` must keep those placeholders exactly as written — only translate the surrounding text
- Unicode characters (arrows, bullets, em-dashes) can be kept as-is or replaced with equivalents that make sense in your language
- Poedit shows you which strings are still untranslated so you can track your progress

## Step 4 — Translate and Test Lesson Files

The six JSON lesson files are in `globalPlugins/nvdaCoach/lessons/[lang]/`. You can edit these in any plain text editor — Notepad works fine.

### What to translate

Each lesson step looks like this:

```json
{
  "instruction": "Press NVDA+F1 to open the NVDA help menu.",
  "hint": "Hold NVDA, then press F1."
}
```

Translate the `instruction`, `hint`, and `text` fields. Leave everything else exactly as-is — do **not** change:

- `"id"` values
- `"type"` values
- `"gesture"` and `"expectedGestures"` — these are key codes, not text
- `"title"` and `"description"` at the chapter level if you are unsure

### Files and chapters

| File | Chapter |
|---|---|
| `getting_started.json` | Chapter 1: Getting Started with NVDA |
| `reading_text.json` | Chapter 3: Reading and Moving Through Text |
| `browse_mode.json` | Chapter 4: Browse Mode and Web Navigation |
| `object_navigation.json` | Chapter 5: Object Navigation |
| `nvda_settings.json` | Chapter 6: Customizing NVDA |
| `keyboard_reference.json` | Chapter 2: Your Keyboard |

### Testing

After editing a lesson file, copy it into the add-on folder and restart NVDA. Open NVDA Coach with `NVDA+Shift+C`, choose the lesson, and run through it to hear your translation.

## Step 5 — Translate and Test Documentation

The three HTML files in `doc/[lang]/` can be edited in any text editor. Translate the visible text between the HTML tags — leave the tags themselves untouched.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `readme.html` | Main user guide — opened with F4 inside NVDA Coach |
| `practice.html` | Practice page used during Browse Mode lessons |
| `resources.html` | Additional resources and links |

To test: copy your updated file into the add-on folder. In NVDA Coach, press **F4** to open the help documentation and confirm it shows your translation.

## Submitting Your Translation

When you're ready — or when you have a batch ready — **zip up your translated files and reply to your open GitHub issue** with the zip attached. No pull request needed.

Files to include:

```
locale\[lang]\LC_MESSAGES\nvda.po
locale\[lang]\LC_MESSAGES\nvda.mo
globalPlugins\nvdaCoach\lessons\[lang]\    (all six .json files)
doc\[lang]\                                (readme.html, practice.html, resources.html)
locale\[lang]\manifest.ini                 (add-on description in your language, if translated)
```

You don't have to submit everything at once. Partial translations are welcome — submit what you have and we'll track the rest in the issue.
